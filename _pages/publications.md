    Stellar mass loss is the process by which stellar matter is expelled from the surface of a star through phenomena such as winds, pulsation-induced shocks, and radiation pressure. However, mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) has yet to be well-constrained observationally or understood theoretically. Specifically, previous RGB mass loss studies of open clusters and globular clusters are inconsistent with each other. There is a critical need for alternative methods to measure mass loss in order to understand and resolve these discrepancies. 

We use red clump and subgiant wide binaries from the El-Badry+2021 catalog as a pilot study to investigate RGB mass loss. I extracted the oscillation frequencies of each RC star from TESS light curves and infer the stellar properties of each star based on a set of observables. I then fit the wide binary sample to \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{GYRE} stellar evolution models using observational, asteroseismic, and coevality constraints in order to estimate the stellar mass loss of the primary RC star in each binary. We concluded that the stellar mass loss determined from our analyses are more consistent with the smaller values ($\leq 0.1~M_{\odot}$) estimated from seismic studies of open clusters rather than the larger mass loss values inferred from globular clusters.

## Kinematics and Star-formation History of Willman 1: A Disrupting Dwarf Galaxy

Our own Milky Way galaxy is orbited by smaller satellite galaxies, aptly named dwarf galaxies. The smallest and dimmest of these galaxy satellites are the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs), whose mass are dominated by dark matter. In 2005, the first UFD discovered was Willman 1 (W1), and since then many more have been identified thanks to large surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). UFDs are useful to study a wide array of astrophysical phenomena including stellar nucleosynthesis, dark matter, and cosmology. However, even 20 years after its initial discovery, there continues to be ambiguity as to the classification of W1 as a dwarf galaxy and its tidal disruption status.

We use homogeneously reduced spectroscopy of W1 from the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck-II telescope, including unpublished archival data (Geha et al, 2025), in conjunction with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to determine W1 members. I develop an original probablistic framework for membership selection, resulting in a sample of 56 member stars. From the member sample, I analyzed properties such as velocity distribution, mass segregation, and metallicity distribution. I performed dynamical analyses to determine the orbital history of Willman 1, including its simulated 3D orbit, simulated stellar streams, and tidal radius calculations. We conclude that evidence points to W1's classification as a dwarf galaxy due to an internal velocity dispersion, lack of mass segregation based on HST photometry, and spectroscopic metallicity dispersion. We also find evidence that W1 is tidally disrupted based on its extended spatial distribution, irregular kinematic distribution, and best-fit orbital solutions.

## Testing the Accuracy of the Tangent Point Method for Determining the Milky Way’s Inner Rotation Curve

Since as early as 1954, the Tangent Point Method (TPM) has been used to calculate the inner portion of the Milky Way's rotation curve using neutral hydrogen gas 21cm observations. The TPM states that in one line of sight, the observed radial velocity will be an extremum at the tangent point because that is where the full velocity vector is observed, as opposed to just a component of it . Thus, finding the extremum radial velocity allows one to calculate both the Galactocentric radius and the circular velocity. This method was used in early estimates of the Milky Way's rotation curve in order to model its mass distribution and kinematics, which provided some of the first pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter.

I designed and executed analyses testing the accuracy of the TPM by comparing the rotation curve derived from the TPM with that derived from direct measurements of the motions of stars from the Gaia satellite. I found a statistically significant difference, providing evidence that the TPM is inaccurate and implying that the Milky Way’s rotation curve is shallower than previously thought.
