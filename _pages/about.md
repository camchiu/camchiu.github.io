I am a senior undergraduate at Yale University pursuing a B.S. in astrophysics. My research interests broadly include Milky Way dynamics, dwarf galaxies, asteroseismology, and near-field cosmology.

Since my first-year, I have been working with [Marla Geha](https://geha-group.github.io/) to constrain the chemical and dynamical properties of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Willman 1. I spent last summer as an REU student at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa working with Professor Dan Huber, Dr. Yaguang Li, and Dr. Joel Ong to constrain mass loss on the red giant branch. This summer, I am studying Milky Way dynamics at the Max Planck Institue for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany with Professor Hans-Walter Rix and Vedant Chandra.
